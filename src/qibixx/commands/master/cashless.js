 * Enable/Disable Cashless Master
 * Prior to initiating transactions with the MDB Bus, it is necessary to Enable the Cashless Master. Specifically for Cashless Devices, in addition to "Idle" Mode, it is also possible to enable the Device in "Always Idle" Mode.
 *
 * "Authorization First" First Mode - Vending sessions are initiated by the Cashless Peripherals (Meaning that in a real terminal, the user would first have to swipe his card to pre-authorize a certain amount, and then select the product. Further information in Cashless Slave).
 *
 * "Always Idle"/Selection First Mode (direct vend), the Master can request the credit to the Cashless Slave first, and therefore it will start the session (In a real terminal, the user would select the product first on the machine, and then swipe the card to confirm the requested amount).

/**
 * Get Cashless Status From Master

 * Answer:

 *
 * <featurelevel>,<CurrCode>,<scalefac>,<decimals>,<timeout> and <flags> <direct_vend_mode>are all part of the information exchanged between the Cashless Terminal and the VMC during setup. Please refer to section 7.4.2 of the MDB Specification for more details about these fields.
 *
 * status: The state of the Cashless Reader:
 * INIT: The reader is active but waiting to be enabled (meaning it is not yet ready to accept payments)
 * IDLE: The reader is Enabled, waiting for a session to be started(If Idle/Authorization First), or a vend request from the machine(If always Idle/Selection First).
 * VEND: The reader has received a request for a value and is processing it (the VMC is waiting for the reader to confirm the transaction).
 * RESULT: The result of the vend request. In other words, tells if the reader approved the request. If so, the result will be d,STATUS,RESULT,1,<credit>,#,.....
 *
 * featurelevel: Reader announced MDB Feature level
 * CurrCode: Reader Currency Code
 * scalefac: Country/Currency Code
 * decimals: Decimal Places
 * timeout: Application Maximum Response time (s)
 * flags: Miscellaneous options announced by the reader during the setup
 * direct_vend___mode: It will display 1 or 2 depending if you start with D,1 or D,2.
 *
 * NOTE: Even if you start with D,2 but the machine does not support it, it will display 1
