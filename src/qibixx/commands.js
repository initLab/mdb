 * status: The state of the Cashless Reader:

 * IDLE: The reader is Enabled, waiting for a session to be started(If Idle/Authorization First), or a vend request from the machine(If always Idle/Selection First).
 * VEND: The reader has received a request for a value and is processing it (the VMC is waiting for the reader to confirm the transaction).
 * RESULT: The result of the vend request. In other words, tells if the reader approved the request. If so, the result will be d,STATUS,RESULT,1,<credit>,#,.....

 * featurelevel: Reader announced MDB Feature level
 * CurrCode: Reader Currency Code
 * scalefac: Country/Currency Code
